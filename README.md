 About Me ðŸ‘‹  
Hey there! ðŸ˜„ My name is Bibiana Jumwa Muasya, a passionate Nutrition Specialist and Cloud Solutions Architect with over 10 years of experience in public health, food security, and technology-driven program management. Iâ€™m currently exploring the intersection of nutrition, data analytics, and cloud computing to create scalable, tech-enhanced solutions that improve global health outcomes.  

I hold a Masterâ€™s degree in Human Nutrition and certifications in AWS Cloud Solutions and Microsoft 365 Architecture. My expertise lies in designing cloud-powered data pipelines, leveraging machine learning for nutrition analytics, and implementing sustainable nutrition programs across diverse humanitarian contexts.  

Iâ€™m also diving deeper into the tech world, learning Python, R, and data visualization tools to enhance my ability to analyze and interpret complex datasets. Iâ€™m passionate about using technology to bridge gaps in nutrition programming, making data more accessible and actionable for decision-makers.  

When Iâ€™m not working on nutrition and tech projects, I enjoy volunteering my time to contribute to open-source initiatives and exploring innovative ways to integrate AI and cloud solutions into public health. Iâ€™m a strong advocate for data-driven decision-making and believe in the power of technology to create meaningful, scalable impact.  

Iâ€™m always excited to collaborate with like-minded individuals and organizations on cool, innovative, and impactful projects. If youâ€™re working on something that aligns with my skills and passions, letâ€™s connect!
